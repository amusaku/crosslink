## PostgreSQL Backup and Restore in Kubernetes using Pods

This guide provides step-by-step instructions for backing up and restoring your PostgreSQL database running in a
**Kubernetes** environment, using **Pods** that perform one-time tasks for backup and restore.

### 1. Stop the TBMQ StatefulSet Before Backup

Before performing any backup or restore, itâ€™s important to stop the TBMQ StatefulSet to avoid any inconsistencies or
write operations to the database during the process.

#### Command to Scale Down TBMQ StatefulSet:

```bash
kubectl scale statefulset tb-broker --replicas=0
```

This command will stop the TBMQ StatefulSet by scaling it down to 0 replicas, ensuring no traffic hits the database
during backup/restore.

### 2. PostgreSQL Backup Pod

The **`postgres-backup`** pod uses the `pg_dump` command to create a backup of the PostgreSQL database.

#### Pod YAML (`postgres-backup`):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: postgres-backup
  namespace: thingsboard-mqtt-broker
spec:
  containers:
    - name: postgres-backup
      image: postgres:15
      command:
        - /bin/bash
        - -ec
        - |
          echo "$(date) Backup started!"
          pg_dump -Fc -v -h tb-database -U postgres -d thingsboard_mqtt_broker > /backups/tbmq_backup.dump
          echo "$(date) Backup completed!"
      env:
        - name: PGPASSWORD
          value: "postgres"
      volumeMounts:
        - name: backup-volume
          mountPath: /backups
  restartPolicy: Never
  volumes:
    - name: backup-volume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: postgres-pv-claim
```

#### Explanation:

- **`pg_dump` command**: This command creates a custom-format PostgreSQL database backup and saves it in
  `/backups/tbmq_backup.dump`.
- **Environment Variable**: `PGPASSWORD` is used to provide the PostgreSQL password.
- **Volume Mount (`backup-volume`)**: The pod mounts a PersistentVolumeClaim (PVC) where the backup file will be
  stored (`/backups`).
- **Restart Policy**: The pod will not restart automatically after the backup completes.

#### To Run the Backup Pod:

1. **Apply the Backup Pod YAML**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f backup-restore/backup.yml
   ```

2. **Check the Pod Status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

3. **View Logs to Confirm Backup Completion**:
   Once the pod completes, check the logs to verify the backup was successful:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs postgres-backup
   ```

4. **Clean Up the Backup Pod** (Optional):
   After completion, you can delete the backup pod if needed:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod postgres-backup
   ```

### 3. PostgreSQL Restore Pod

The **`postgres-restore`** pod uses the `pg_restore` command to restore the PostgreSQL database from a backup.

#### Pod YAML (`postgres-restore`):

```yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Pod
metadata:
  name: postgres-restore
  namespace: thingsboard-mqtt-broker
spec:
  containers:
    - name: postgres-restore
      image: postgres:15
      command:
        - /bin/bash
        - -ec
        - |
          echo "$(date) Restore started!"
          pg_restore -c -v -h tb-database -U postgres -d thingsboard_mqtt_broker /backups/tbmq_backup.dump || true
          echo "$(date) Restore completed!"
      env:
        - name: PGPASSWORD
          value: "postgres"
      volumeMounts:
        - name: restore-volume
          mountPath: /backups
      workingDir: /backups
  restartPolicy: Never
  volumes:
    - name: restore-volume
      persistentVolumeClaim:
        claimName: postgres-pv-claim
```

#### Explanation:

- **`pg_restore` command**: Restores the PostgreSQL database from the backup file (`/backups/tbmq_backup.dump`).
- **Volume Mount (`restore-volume`)**: The pod mounts the PVC where the backup file is stored.
- **Error Handling**: The `|| true` ensures the pod doesn't exit with an error even if certain constraints or tables
  can't be dropped (e.g., inherited constraints).
- **Restart Policy**: The pod will not restart automatically after completing the restore operation.

#### To Run the Restore Pod:

1. **Apply the Restore Pod YAML**:
   ```bash
   kubectl apply -f backup-restore/restore.yml
   ```

2. **Check the Pod Status**:
   ```bash
   kubectl get pods
   ```

3. **View Logs to Confirm Restore Completion**:
   Once the restore process completes, check the logs:
   ```bash
   kubectl logs postgres-restore
   ```

4. **Verify Restore Success**:
   Check the database directly to ensure the restore was successful, or review the logs for any errors.

5. **Clean Up the Restore Pod** (Optional):
   After completion, you can delete the restore pod:
   ```bash
   kubectl delete pod postgres-restore
   ```

### 4. Start the TBMQ StatefulSet After Restore

Once the restore operation is complete, start the TBMQ StatefulSet by scaling it back up to its previous replica count.

#### Command to Scale Up TBMQ StatefulSet:

```bash
kubectl scale statefulset tb-broker --replicas=2
```

This will bring the TBMQ StatefulSet back online and resume normal operations.
